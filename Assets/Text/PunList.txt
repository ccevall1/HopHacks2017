You've cat to be kitten me
I know you're feline bad but UI think you're purrfect
Let's catnip that sadness in the bud
Cat hold me down
Cat stop believing
Yes we cat
Don't purrmit others to tell you what you cat do
Don't be afraid of a little catastrophe
Claw your way to your dreams
Stay pawsitive
Catitude is everything
Life would be clawful without you
You're pawsome
You're individual, not a copycat
That was then, this is meow
Don't give up meow
I like your catitude
You are meowgical
This pussy grabs back
